## Key Features
* **Fast face scanning** and â‰¥â€¯90â€¯% recognition accuracy.
* **Roleâ€‘based dashboards** â€” Students, Teachers, and Admins each get scoped views.  
* **Firebase Firestore** persistence with serverâ€‘side rules.

## Firestore Attendance Schema

Manual rechecks now gatekeep each face scan for up to **45â€¯minutes**. The backend writes the first result as a _pending_ attendance record so downstream dashboards must filter them out until staff complete the review.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `studentID` | `string` | UID of the student who attempted the scan. |
| `classID` | `string` | Class identifier that the scan was submitted against. |
| `date` | `timestamp` | Central Time timestamp for when the scan hit the API. |
| `status` | `string` | **`"pending"`** until a reviewer promotes the record to `"Present"`, `"Late"`, etc. |
| `isPending` | `boolean` | Convenience flag; `true` while `status === "pending"`. Always filter these out of live attendance views. |
| `proposedStatus` | `string` | The status computed from the class schedule (e.g., `"Present"` or `"Late"`). Use this when the reviewer finalizes the record. |
| `createdAt` / `updatedAt` | `server timestamp` | Firestore server timestamps that track when the attempt was stored and last updated. |
| `pendingRecheckAt` | `timestamp` | When the 45-minute follow-up window expires. Frontends should keep the scan modal open until this time or until the record is finalized. |
| `networkEvidence` | `map` | Contains `remoteAddr`, `xForwardedFor`, `xRealIp`, `userAgent`, `forwardedProto`, and `requestId` captured from the request headers to support audit trails. |
| `verification` | `map` | DeepFace metrics such as `distance`, `threshold`, and `model` used for the comparison. |

### Display guidance for clients

1. **Hide pending records** in dashboards by checking `status !== "pending"` _or_ `isPending === false`.
2. **Show in-progress UI** while a userâ€™s most recent record for the day is pending; the backend response includes `pending: true` and `recheck_due_at` for convenience.
3. **Only mark attendance complete** once staff (or an automated job) updates the documentâ€™s `status` and clears the `isPending` flag.

## Deployment

### Backend â†’ Render
1. **Create a new Web Service** in Render.  
2. **Connect** your GitHub repo and select the `/backend` directory as the root.  
3. **Environment:** `Python 3`, start command `python app.py`.  
4. Add environment variables from `backend/.env`.  
5. Every push to `main` automatically redeploys.

### Frontend â†’ FirebaseÂ Hosting
```bash
# oneâ€‘time setup
firebase init hosting
# each deploy
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```
